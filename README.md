## This project was built for phase 1 of the Microsoft Student Accelerator programme, it's also my first journey into web development!

The requirements of the project were to: 

- Create a new web app with React + Typescript
- Connect the web app to a 3rd party REST API
- Allow the user to enter information relevant to the chosen API and display what the API returns based on what they entered
- Use a UI component library
- Use Docker to build our web app into a Docker image
- Use Azure Web App for Containers to deploy our docker image
- Use Github for source control

## This submission

This submission is a web-app that searches for anime on myanimelist.net via the jikan REST API. As this was my first time doing anything on the web, I tried to keep things simple as I would be learning a lot of different things at the same time.

The sites current functions include: 

- Searching for anime via the searchbar and displaying the results
- Displaying the current weeks schedule for anime releases on the homepage
